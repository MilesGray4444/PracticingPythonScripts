# PracticingPythonScripts

Running scripts on Mac OS Terminal.

These are all python scripts version1, 2 are simple.
Version 3 assigns '> ' to a user prompt and I tweaked it around a bit

Setting parameters and unpacking variables. this is just painful way to do it.
Don't worry.


Version 3 will be done tomorrow.
